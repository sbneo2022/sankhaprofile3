          Sankha finished his doctoral thesis applying machine learning to
          non-linear dynamical systems from
          <a href="https://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a>. He finished his finance degree
          from the Sloan School of Management at
          <a href="https://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During his PhD he focussed on using supercomputing facilities
          available to <a href="https://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a> researchers, for
          the first time to simulate a

          Current passion is in designing event driven Systems for
          high-frequency market making. Sankha operates an inhouse event-driven
          liquidity-providing trading strategy at ultra-low latency while
          maintaining a relatively neutral position on the top crypto-exchanges
          and a major DEX. The plan is to release the whitepaper, and
          open-source the system for community development from like minded
          researchers and traders. Currently the code is used with some
          researchers from MIT and Harvard to investigate the effect of
          cancellations on market quality and the agent's profitability on
          crypto-exchanges.
